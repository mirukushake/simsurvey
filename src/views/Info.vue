        <p>Okay, so this wasn't a very scientific survey. It's been a decade since I took a survey methods class and didn't even have anyone check it first (apparently my
          spellchecker doesn't discriminate and believes all spelling of "occasionally" are created equal). A lot of the data was cleaned up manually or MacGuyvered it so it was good enough,
          so I can't guarantee total accuracy. However, I hope it gave a decent general view into how people like
          to play The Sims 4.
        </p>
        <p>Unfortunately, I missed some (totally obvious now that I think about it) things like favorite traits and aspirations, favorite mods, etc. I guess that is always something
          I can work on at a later date! Right now, however, I might scream if I have to look at another Excel formula or line of Javascript.
        </p>
        <p>You can see the <a href="https://forms.gle/FQkkfeGKxxrz5vsj7">original form here</a> and the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15WVi8uFdX6wN0alMT-ftL8VpMuk01AciO3gFLKWjlI0/edit?usp=sharing">results in their raw form here</a>. And if you want to drop me a line about the survey, feel free to contact me over at reddit, u/mirukushake.</p>
