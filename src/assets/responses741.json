I then plan to play out their lives similar to how they unfolded through those two games. I also love recreating houses from video games I've played.","Any other comments?\r":"Most of my time with TS4 has been browsing, downloading, organizing, and testing CC so I have comparably little time spent in the game compared to many others even though I've had the game since 2015.  But I also stopped playing for many years because the time between interesting content was too long and the base game mechanics are just kinda boring.  I love the building tools and so I have sparks of inspiration that make me jump in and build something but I tend to engage rather little with the sims themselves despite my plans to do so.  But the fixed lots with generally small sizes tends to stymie some creativity and the the fact that updates tend to break mods is endlessly frustrating and keeps me away from devoting more time to the game.\"\r\n8/7/2019 8:49:01,Legacy/family gameplay,No,None,Yes,All,Yes,,\"Get to Work, City Living, Seasons"},{"Timestamp":"8/7/2019 8:49:07","What is your main play style?":"Legacy/family gameplay","Do you use custom content?":"No","If you use CC, which style do you prefer?":"None","Do you use mods?":"Yes","Have you played any other (major) Sims games?":"All","Do you have any DLC?":"Yes","DLC completion":"","Favorite EP for gameplay":"Get to Work, City Living, Seasons","Favorite EP for build/buy":"City Living, Seasons, Get Famous","Favorite EP for CAS":"City Living, Get Famous","Favorite GP for gameplay":"Vampires, Parenthood, Strangerville","Favorite GP for build/buy":"Vampires, Strangerville","Favorite GP for CAS":"Vampires, Parenthood, Strangerville","Favorite Stuff Pack for gameplay":"Romantic Garden Stuff[","Favorite Stuff Pack for build/buy":"Romantic Garden Stuff[","Favorite Stuff Pack for CAS":"None","Do you enjoy creating sims?":"Very much","Do you have free will on or off?":"On","Do you generally try to control all sims in a household?":"Yes","Do you have aging on or off?":"On - Long","What is your preferred starter household?":"Single sim (Young Adult)","If you have Cats & Dogs, do you prefer to start with pets or adopt them?":"No preference","Do you stay with one family or rotate?":"Rotate often","If you play legacy style, what do you do with spares?":"Haven’t played legacy ","How many generations was your longest legacy?":2,"Do you usually keep or delete the premade sims (Pancakes, Goths, etc":{")":"Keep them in world"},"Do you use sims from the gallery/CC creators as playable sims?":"Never","Do you use sims from the gallery/CC creators as townies/NPC sims?":"Occassionally","Do you use money-related cheats (money, freerealestate, etc":{")?":"Occassionally"},"Do you use skill-related cheats?":"Occassionally","Do you use career-related cheats?":"Occassionally","Which career(s) do you play the most?":"Culinary, Writer, Freelancer","Do you enjoy building houses/apartments?":"Somewhat","Do you enjoy building community lots?":"Very little","If you have City Living, do you prefer standalone homes or apartments?":"Apartments","Do you enjoy decoration/interior design?":"Somewhat","Do you use lots from the gallery/CC creators?":"Ocassionally","How many hours do you have in the game?":40,"How many active saves do you have?":4,"Do you do challenges (legacy challenge, 100 baby challenge, etc":{")?":"Rarely"},"If you do challenges, what are some you enjoy?":"","What are your play style \"\"quirks\"\"?":"Tend to always start with a young adult female.
